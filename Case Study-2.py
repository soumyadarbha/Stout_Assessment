# The below plot shows the trends of each column in the dataset for each year

import pandas as pd

Total_Revenue.groupby('year').nunique().plot(kind='bar')
plt.show()


# In[72]:


# The below plot shows the frequency of net_revenue. As shown below, there is uniform distribution of net_revenue.

# In[74]:


YearbyRevenue


# In[75]:


# The below plot displays the total net_revenue for each year

# In[78]:


# The below plot indicates the number of times each customer_email has been repeated. 

Total_Revenue['customer_email'].value_counts().hist()

# The below plot shows the top 10 customers with highest net_revenue (in descending order)

Top_Customers.plot(kind="bar", fontsize=8)


# ### Some of the interesting observations from above plots and graphs are :
# ### 1. The year 2017 has the maximum net_revenue. 
# ### 2. Maximum number of customer emails are unique. 
# ### 3. There is uniform distribution in the frequency of net_revenue.
# ### 4. Along with net_revenue, highest number of customer emails have been registered for the year 2017
